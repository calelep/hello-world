# hello-world
# This is my first attempt at Programming and I am doing it by way of learning Python
# I will be posting very raw rookie exercises to help me get better over time, and I am looking forward to it
# I am also open to mentoring or help from anyone that wants to point me in the right direction. Thank you for your time
